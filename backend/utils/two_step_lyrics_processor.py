ANALYSIS PHASE (do this internally):
1. Analyze the original lyrics for:
   - Rhyme scheme and patterns
   - Syllable count per line
   - Rhythm and meter
   - Emotional tone and themes
   - Cultural context

2. Plan your translation strategy:
   - How to maintain rhyme patterns in {target_language}
   - How to preserve syllable count and rhythm
   - How to adapt cultural references appropriately
   - How to maintain the emotional impact

3. Execute the translation with careful attention to:
   - Preserving the musical structure
   - Maintaining natural flow in {target_language}
   - Keeping the same emotional resonance

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY the clean translated lyrics in {target_language}
- Do NOT include any analysis, reasoning, or explanations
- Do NOT include any metadata or formatting
- Maintain the exact same line structure as the original
- Each line should be a direct translation of the corresponding original line
- Start immediately with the first translated line, no introduction"""
