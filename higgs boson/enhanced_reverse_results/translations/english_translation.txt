Moving on to the English parts: "Nara no node kono Qipt iu toki de mayoi nakutaku mo mikka sai" – "Nara" might refer to the city, but here it could be part of a name or a typo. "Qipt" is likely a misspelling of "Quip" or another word. The phrase "iu toki de mayoi nakutaku mo" translates to "at this time, I don't want to be lost in confusion." The last part "Woahそのチッドスェダヴェジャァャワワアイ長 大的長長 長カマッ" seems to have some mixed languages and possible slang or typos. "Woah" is English, followed by "そのチッドスェダヴェジャァャワワアイ" which might be a mix of Japanese and English words, possibly "that chiddu svedavejawaai" – but this is unclear. The repetition of "長" and "大的長長 長カマッ" could be emphasizing length or something else, maybe stylized for effect.

paths that mirror sudden sparks, the way of responding to those who wander, the end of wild trails, resting where they may—
as they fall deeper, the heart burns brighter, so warm,
that in this moment of Qipt in Nara, I don’t want to be lost to confusion.
Woah, that Chiddu Svedavejawaai—Long, long, long, Camma.
